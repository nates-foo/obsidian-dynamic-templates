# Obsidian Dynamic Templates Plugin

⚠️ — **This plugin is in early development.** It may be subject to breaking changes and you are using it at your own risk.

**The main goal of this plugin is to offer templates whose content can be updated when state changes (like [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)) AND otherwise exists as plain Markdown.** Should you stop using the plugin, or Obsidian altogether, you will not lose the dynamic content that has already been generated in your notes. And, because the templates produce plain Markdown, they are fully compatible with [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish).

- A dynamic template can be inserted as a section anywhere in a Markdown note.
- Templates are backed by a JavaScript file which outputs Markdown.
- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)'s JavaScript API can be used.
- The content generated by the templates is saved as regular Markdown.
- In reading view, or if the note is published, only the generated content is visible.

## Basic Usage

In order to remain invisible in reading view, the dynamic templates syntax uses [Markdown comments](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax#Comments):

```
%% template: 'templates/foobar.js' %%
```

Where `templates/foobar.js` refers to a JavaScript file in your vault which returns arbitrary Markdown, for example:

```js
// File: templates/foobar.js
const date = new Date().toLocaleDateString();
return `## Header
- Foo
- Bar
- Date: ${date}`;
```

**When the template is activated (using a shortcut, for example), the note is automatically edited and our original template declaration turns into:**

```
%% template: 'templates/foobar.js' %%
## Header
- Foo
- Bar
- Date: 2/21/2024
%%%%
```

`%% template: … %%` marks the beginning of the templated section, and `%%%%` its end. Because they're Markdown comments, they don't show in reading view, but the header and the list do. **Each time the template is activated, its current content is replaced with the new one.** For example, if we run this template the next day, this section of the note will be updated to:

```
%% template: 'templates/foobar.js' %%
## Header
- Foo
- Bar
- Date: 2/22/2024
%%%%
```
